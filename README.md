# rsGBA

A GBA emulator written in Rust.

Thanks to a guy named Ferris and his project [Rustendo 64](https://github.com/yupferris/rustendo64), many people got motivated to write their own emulators in Rust. Even I wasn't spared, so here it is, my GBA emulator.

And why GBA?

- It is ARM-based and ARM is sexy.
- I want to play Metroid Zero Mission and Fusion with it.
- It can handle GBC games as well.

# Features

- Integreated disassembler.
	- Disassemble individual instructions via command line:
	- Disassemble sections of the loaded ROM.
- TODO

# Build and Run

Building the emulator currently requires a nightly Rust installation, version 1.8 or higher. If you have it, you can `cd` into the source directory and do one of the following:

- To run all tests, execute `cargo test`.
- To generate an HTML documentation for the source code, execute `cargo doc`.
- To build the emulator, execute `cargo build --release`.
- To run the emulator, execute `cargo run -- ARGS...` with any command line arguments `ARGS...`. You may want to try `cargo run -- --help` to get a list of all supported command line arguments.

# Tools
- **[wxHexEditor](http://www.wxhexeditor.org/)**
	
	> a free hex editor / disk editor for Linux, Windows and MacOSX
	
	So far my favourite hex editor. It is obviously a GUI application based on [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/).
- **[MSYS2](https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/)**
	
	> A Cygwin-derived software distro for Windows using Arch Linux's Pacman
	
	If you work on a Windows machine but find yourself wanting to use Bash, binutils, and other Linux tools, then this might be just what you needed.
- **[Notepad++ Rust Syntax](https://github.com/pfalabella/Rust-notepadplusplus)**
	
	> Notepad++ syntax highlighting for Rust.
	
	There are some missing highlights like the keyword `crate`, but these are easily added by hand.
	
- **[Online Disassembler](https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/)**
	
	> Disassembly in the cloud.
	
	As the name states: A website disassembling your binaries. Just copy and paste sections of your ROM files and have fun. Note that the GBA works in Little Endian mode.

- **[ARM7TDMI Instruction Set Reference](http://morrow.ece.wisc.edu/ECE353/arm7tdmi_instruction_set_reference.pdf)**
	
	> Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Wisconsin-Madison
	
	Thanks to those guys, here is an instruction set reference manual for the ARM7TDMI, which is the very CPU used in the GBA.
