# GBArs

A GBA emulator written in Rust.

Thanks to a guy named Ferris and his project [Rustendo 64](https://github.com/yupferris/rustendo64), many people got motivated to write their own emulators in Rust. Even I wasn't spared, so here it is, my GBA emulator.

And why GBA?

- It is ARM-based and ARM is sexy.
- I want to play Metroid Zero Mission and Fusion with it.
- It can handle GBC games as well.

# Features

- A stupid name, pronounced: "G-B-Ars"
- Integreated disassembler.
	- Disassemble individual instructions via command line.
	- Disassemble sections of the loaded ROM via command line.
	- Mimics the standard ARM assembly language, although some parts of the syntax work differently. The integrated disassembler also does not support pseudo instructions like `push`/`pop`, to make the code simpler.
- Optional optimised BIOS routines.
- It is entirely written in Rust, a safe and awesome language.
- TODO

# Build and Run

Building the emulator currently requires a nightly Rust installation, version 1.8 or higher. If you have it, you can `cd` into the source directory and do one of the following:

- To run all tests, execute `cargo test`.
- To generate an HTML documentation for the source code, execute `cargo doc`.
- To build the emulator, execute `cargo build --release`.
- To run the emulator, execute `cargo run -- ARGS...` with any command line arguments `ARGS...`. You may want to try `cargo run -- --help` to get a list of all supported command line arguments.

# Examples

- **Change the log file**
			
			GBArs --log path/to/logfile.log
			
- **Run a game**
	
	The SRAM file contains any saved data.
			
			GBArs --rom ./ZeroMission.gba --load-sram
			
- **Disassemble an ARM state instruction**
	
	The instruction to disassemble must be given in big endian hexadecimal format without base.
			
			GBArs --dasm-arm DEADBEEF
			
- **Disassemble a section of the BIOS**
	
	Disassembles the first 128 bytes, 32 ARM state instructions. This also loads a BIOS ROM from any given file. If no such file is given, an internal default BIOS ROM will be loaded.
			
			GBArs --bios ./GbaBios.gba --dasm-bios 0..80

# Tools
- **[wxHexEditor](http://www.wxhexeditor.org/)**

	> a free hex editor / disk editor for Linux, Windows and MacOSX

	So far my favourite hex editor. It is obviously a GUI application based on [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/).
- **[ATOM](https://atom.io/)**

    > A hackable text editor

    This is quite a decent source code editor and it's what I'm currently using to develop GBArs. For this project here I at least recommend using these packages:

    - `editorconfig` for tab settings and what not.
    - `language-rust` for Rust language support.
    - `linter-rust` for showing warnings etc. in the status bar.
- **[Online Disassembler](https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/)**

	> Disassembly in the cloud.

	As the name states: A website disassembling your binaries. Just copy and paste sections of your ROM files and have fun. To use it, apply the following settings:
	
	- **Arch**: ARMv4T (T = THUMB support)
	- **Endian**: Little
	- **Force THUMB Mode**: Default (Might need to toggle in case the disassembly is wrong.)
	- **Register Names**: reg-names-std (Just a matter of taste.)
	
	A hint on how you recognise whether the website erroneously disassembles ARM instructions as THUMB instructions: The first instruction of a BIOS or GamePak ROM file is almost always an unconditional ARM state branch like `b loc_00000058`.
	
	Also note that ARMv4 is just the "instruction set version". Although the GBA's CPU is an ARM7TDMI (again, T = THUMB), its instruction set is ARMv4.
- **[ARM7TDMI Technical Reference Manual](http://www.atmel.com/Images/ddi0029g_7tdmi_r3_trm.pdf)**
	
	> This document is Open Access. This document has no restriction on distribution.
	
	This PDF also includes a data sheet on the THUMB state instruction set. There aren't, however, no detailed notes on what the different instructions actually do, as this manual focuses more on delays and signals.
- **[ARM7TDMI Instruction Set Reference](http://morrow.ece.wisc.edu/ECE353/arm7tdmi_instruction_set_reference.pdf)**

	> Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Wisconsin-Madison

	Thanks to those guys, here is an instruction set reference manual for the ARM7TDMI, which is the very CPU used in the GBA.
